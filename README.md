## Table of Contents

## About <a name = "about"></a>

Paste a body of text (i.e., an article, essay, etc.) and QuickSum will generate a summary of it for you. Coded using Svelte




- Currently only pasting the actual text in the textarea will work, meaning no URLs.

(the following is a WIP)
![A side by side view of summary to article, allowing you to click on a highlighted part of the summary and the model will attempt to map it to the best match within the original article.](image.png)
