## About <a name = "about"></a>

Paste an article URL or a body of text, and we will generate a summary for you, clean and simple.


You can select a key part in the summary view, and if you want to share it all you need to do is click a button in the article view for the corresponding text to generate a text fragment link to the original article webpage.

- Currently only pasting the actualt text in the textarea will work, meaning no URLs.

(the following is a WIP)
